RecenseAI: Intelligent Census Platform
Project Description
RecenseAI is an interactive web platform designed to simplify the analysis, visualization, and sharing of census data. It enables users to make data-driven decisions through advanced analytical tools, intuitive visualizations, and community-driven features.

This platform is developed specifically to support the needs of RGPH 2024, providing a complete solution for managing statistical datasets, generating automated reports, and fostering collaboration.
Project Structure
To ensure clarity and simplicity of reading, the codebase is divided into two main parts:

Backend: Developed using Django and Django Rest Framework (DRF).
Frontend: Developed using React.js with libraries like Recharts.js for data visualizations.
Key Features
Dataset Management

Import and publish CSV files.
Browse, download, and filter datasets by category (demographics, economy, etc.).
Automatic Visualization

Generate interactive visualizations automatically:
Scatter Plots
Histograms
Donut Charts
Report Generation

Export datasets and visualizations as PDF reports for offline usage.
Integrated Social Network

Create and manage topic-based communities.
Post, like, comment, and favorite content for better engagement.
Recommendation System

Personalized recommendations based on user interactions using collaborative filtering.
Security and Authentication

Secure JWT authentication system for users.
Role-based access permissions for admins and users.
Technologies Used
Backend
Django: Main framework for backend development.
Django Rest Framework (DRF): API design.
MySQL: Database for structured data storage.
Pandas & Numpy: Data manipulation and processing.
JWT Authentication: Secure API authentication with tokens.
Frontend
React.js: Frontend framework for building the UI.
Recharts.js: Library for generating interactive charts and graphs.
jsPDF & html2canvas: For exporting reports in PDF format
Challenges and Solutions
Data Extraction and Visualization:

Solution: Used Pandas for data preprocessing and Recharts.js for rendering data visualizations in the frontend.
Recommendation System:

Solution: Implemented collaborative filtering using user-post interaction matrices and cosine similarity.
JWT Authentication:

Solution: Configured secure API authentication with Django Rest Framework (DRF) to handle user sessions.
Future Improvements
Scalability: Optimize the platform to handle large-scale datasets efficiently.
Enhanced Recommendation Engine: Integrate hybrid recommendation techniques (content + collaborative filtering).
Frontend Performance: Improve API calls and rendering speeds for a smoother user experience.
